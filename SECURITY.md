# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The project is maintained on the `main` branch. Security fixes will generally be
applied to the latest commit on `main`. Releases or tags may be created in the
future as the project matures.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not create a public issue**. Instead, email
   `northstar-maintainers@example.com` with the following details:
   - Description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Potential impact.
   - Any suggested fixes.
2. Encrypt communications if sensitive data is involved; PGP support can be
   arranged via the same email address.
3. You will receive an acknowledgement within 72 hours. We will keep you updated
   on the remediation status and credit you in release notes if desired.

Thank you for helping keep the project secure.
